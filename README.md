### BRIEF "Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features"
___

> BRIEF is a general-purpose feature point descriptor that can be combined with arbitrary detectors. It is robust to typical classes of photometric and geometric image transformations. BRIEF is targeting real-time applications leaving them with a large portion of the available CPU power for subsequent tasks but also allows running feature point matching algorithms on computationally weak devices such as mobile phones.
